# Propertizer
Propertizer is Xcode source extension for easily adding @property commands in ObjectiveC source files.
During Alcatraz plugin era I used a plugin which helped me autocomplete @property using @t shortcut. In Xcode 8 Alcatraz doesn't work so I decided to make an Xcode extension similar to mentioned plugin. Hope you will love it.
